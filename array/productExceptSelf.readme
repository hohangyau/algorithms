1. Iterate through the nums array from left, calculate the cumulative sum except self, store the value in result array.
2. Set the intial value of rightValueSoFar to 1, iterate through the result array from right, multiply the value by rightValueSoFar, update the rightValueSoFar by multiply it to nums[i]

Explaination:
This problem can be divided into two sub problems, the accumulative sum from left hand side X the accumulative sum from right hand side
For instance, given an array [20, 30, 40, 50, 60], the product of item 40 is actually equal to left: 20*30 multiply by right: 50 * 60
